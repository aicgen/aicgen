# Chunk Implementation Plan

## Progress So Far ✅

- [x] Taxonomy defined (~200 chunks)
- [x] TypeScript chunks (10/10) - COMPLETE
- [x] JavaScript chunks (10/10) - COMPLETE
- [x] Python chunks (10/10) - COMPLETE

## Remaining Work 📋

### Language Chunks (50 chunks remaining)
- [ ] Go (10 chunks)
- [ ] Rust (10 chunks)
- [ ] Java (10 chunks)
- [ ] C# (10 chunks)
- [ ] Ruby (10 chunks)

### Architecture Chunks (30 chunks)
- [ ] Microservices (5 chunks)
- [ ] Modular Monolith (5 chunks)
- [ ] Layered Architecture (5 chunks)
- [ ] Hexagonal Architecture (5 chunks)
- [ ] Event-Driven Architecture (5 chunks)
- [ ] Refactoring (5 chunks)

### Cross-Cutting Chunks (70 chunks)
- [ ] Testing (20 chunks)
- [ ] Security (15 chunks)
- [ ] API Design (12 chunks)
- [ ] Database (12 chunks)
- [ ] CI/CD (10 chunks)
- [ ] Error Handling (8 chunks)
- [ ] Performance (10 chunks)
- [ ] Code Style (10 chunks)
- [ ] Logging (6 chunks)
- [ ] Deployment (8 chunks)
- [ ] State Management (6 chunks)

## Two Approaches

### Option 1: Complete Now (Time-Intensive)
Continue creating all ~150 remaining chunks manually with full content.

**Pros:**
- Everything ready immediately
- Complete and comprehensive

**Cons:**
- Very time-consuming (several hours)
- Large context usage

### Option 2: Progressive Enhancement (Recommended)
Create the structure and key samples, provide templates for easy expansion.

**What I'll do:**
1. ✅ Create complete chunks for TypeScript, JavaScript, Python (30 chunks)
2. Create stub structures for remaining languages (50 chunk definitions)
3. Create sample chunks for each architecture type (12 sample chunks)
4. Create sample chunks for each cross-cutting concern (20 sample chunks)
5. Create comprehensive mapping system
6. Provide chunk generation templates

**Benefits:**
- System is functional with 30 complete + 32 sample chunks
- Easy to add remaining chunks incrementally
- Clear template to follow
- Less overwhelming

## Recommendation

Use **Option 2** - this gives you:
- Working system NOW (62 quality chunks covering main scenarios)
- Clear structure for all 200 chunks
- Easy path to complete remaining chunks
- Can add chunks as needed based on actual usage patterns

## Next Steps

1. Create language chunk stubs (Go, Rust, Java, C#, Ruby)
2. Create architecture samples (6 representative chunks)
3. Create cross-cutting samples (20 representative chunks)
4. Build comprehensive mapping system
5. Create generator script for easy chunk addition

Total working chunks: ~60-70 high-quality chunks
Total defined structure: 200 chunks
